This repository contains the archive of PAGE magazine currently held online by the Computer Archive here: https://computer-arts-society.com/casarchive/cas/page.html

The repository was created firstly to dermonstrate how different works or studies might be conducted and saved alongside the original using a online repisotory format. Secondly the CAAs actual colllection is has not undergone optical charector recognition so is not computer readable. 

Processing was a seperate process undertaken with these files to make them readable and usable in the two practice based projects described.  

The repository contains all pdfs, and a structured json file that acts as an index for a LLM to search and retrieve any of the PDFs stored here.
